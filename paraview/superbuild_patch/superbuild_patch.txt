The superbuild will fail giving the following error:
clang-10: error: unsupported option '--unresolved-symbols=ignore-in-shared-libs'

To solve this you need to patch the following file: 
paraview-build/superbuild/paraview/src/VTK/Utilities/Python/CMakeLists.txt

From the root folder of your repository simply call the following command:
cp app-install/paraview/superbuild_patch/CMakeLists.txt paraview-build/superbuild/paraview/src/VTK/Utilities/Python/
